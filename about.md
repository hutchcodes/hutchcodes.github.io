I am an accomplished Software Engineer with over twenty years of experience building, maintaining, and optimizing web applications and backend systems. I have demonstrated expertise in leading projects to reduce costs, enhance quality, increase efficiency, and ensure compliance regulatory compliance.

I helped run the [Casco Bay .Net User Group](https://cbnug.com/) and was awarded Microsoft MVP for Azure from 2017 until 2020 when I joined Microsoft.

I will be blogging about technology, software development and anything else that moves me. I’ll largely focus on Microsoft products because that’s what I use day to day, but I will occasionally provide uninformed comments about other technologies…

You can contact me at any of the following (recruiters may want to read <a href="https://hutchcodes.net/2015/05/the-perfect-job/" >this</a> first)
